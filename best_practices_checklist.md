## ðŸŸ¢ Before Starting a Project

- [ ] Read the [Fundamentals](fundamentals/README.md).
- [ ] Create a clean repository with `.gitignore`.
- [ ] Sketch project directory tree.
- [ ] Gather raw data and store in `data/input/`.

## ðŸŸ¡ Before Running Analysis

- [ ] Activate virtualenv / renv / set Stata paths.
- [ ] Ensure raw data untouched; create copies if needed.

- [ ] Push branch and open Pull Request with clear message.

## ðŸ”´ Before Publication

- [ ] Regenerate **all** results from scratch on fresh machine.

- [ ] Double-check variable definitions against codebook.
- [ ] Archive replication package on Zenodo/OSF with DOI.
- [ ] Add citation for replication package in manuscript.

Pro tip: Automate these steps with CI/CD pipelines and badge your repository with build status and test coverage.
